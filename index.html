        <h3>"Hello, World!" program</h3>
        <p>A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code. It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.</p>
        <h4>Note that HTML is not a programming language</h4>
        <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or <strong>HTML</strong> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>
        <p>It can be assisted by technologies such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cascading Style Sheets (<strong>CSS</strong>)</li>
            <li>and scripting languages such as <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</li>
